# Llama Chat ðŸ¦™

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that demonstrates how to build a chat UI using the [Llama 3](https://replicate.com/meta/llama-3-70b-chat) language model and Replicate's [streaming API (private beta)](https://replicate.com/docs/streaming).

## Security Features

- Rate limiting: 50 requests per minute per IP
- Input validation for all API parameters
- Secure environment variable handling
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- No client-side API token exposure

Here's a demo:

## Setup

1. Get your [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account#token)

2. Set up environment variables:

   For local development, create a `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
   ```

   For Vercel deployment, add the environment variable in your project settings:
   - Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` with your API token
   - **IMPORTANT**: Never commit your API token or expose it in client-side code

3. Configure your domain in `app/layout.js`:
   - Update the `metadataBase` URL to your actual domain
   - Adjust CSP headers if needed for additional domains

## Development

Install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Production Deployment

1. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
2. Configure your web server to:
   - Forward real IP addresses (for rate limiting)
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Set recommended security headers

## Security Best Practices

1. Keep dependencies updated:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. Monitor application logs for suspicious activity

3. Regularly review and update rate limits based on usage patterns

4. Follow security advisories for Next.js and dependencies
